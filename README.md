# Particleboard

A collection of utility classes and extensions for SpriteKit projects.

Inspiration and / or source pulled from other projects includes:

- [SKTUtils](https://github.com/raywenderlich/SKTUtils)
- Multiline Label Node by Alex Studnicka
- [SwiftyBeaver](https://github.com/SwiftyBeaver/SwiftyBeaver) for logging

## Status

In progress.

Not battle hardened and tested. Still useful though.

Not designed for full flexibility. Scope limited to my projects.

## Documentation

Docs are located at [veeneck.github.io/Particleboard](http://veeneck.github.io/Particleboard) and are generated with [Jazzy](https://github.com/Realm/jazzy). The config file for the documentation is in the project as `config.yml`. Docs can be generated by running this command **in** the project directory:

jazzy --config {PATH_TO_REPOSITORY}/Particleboard/Particleboard/config.yml

**Note**: The output in the `config.yml` is hard coded to one computer. Edit the file and update the `output` flag to a valid location.
